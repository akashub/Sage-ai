# Sage.AI - Natural Language SQL Query Assistant

## Description
Sage.AI is an intelligent system that transforms natural language into SQL queries using LLMs and few-shot learning. It executes queries and presents results through an interactive chatbot interface, maintaining context for follow-ups while adapting to different database schemas. We eventually aim to make it data-agnostic so that Sage.ai is a one stop solution for all kinds of use-cases.
 
## Problem Statement
Data analysts and business users often struggle with writing complex SQL queries. While they understand what information they need, translating natural language to SQL is challenging and time-consuming. Existing solutions either lack accuracy, require extensive training, or are limited to specific database schemas. Sage.AI addresses these challenges by providing an intuitive, adaptive interface that handles query generation, execution, and result presentation.

## Initial Proposed AI-System Architecture

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c4f7a92-efd0-44b8-9bce-89bd524722d5)

The AI system consists of three main layers:

### 1. Knowledge Layer
- Few Shot Examples Management
- Vector Store for Similarity Search
- Base Knowledge Base for Query Patterns
- Dataset-Specific Knowledge Base

### 2. Orchestration Layer
- Main Orchestrator for Query Processing
- Node Factory for Component Creation
- Processing Nodes:
 - Analyzer (Natural Language Understanding)
 - Generator (SQL Creation)
 - Validator (Query Safety)
 - Executor (Query Execution)

### 3. Data Layer
- Database Connection Management
- Schema Handling
- Query Execution Engine


## Tech Stack (To be reviewed)

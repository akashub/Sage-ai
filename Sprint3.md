# 🚀 Sprint 3: Knowledge Base and Chat Session Management

## 🌟 Overview

Sprint 3 focused on extending Sage.AI with advanced knowledge management capabilities and improving chat session handling. The primary achievements include implementing a Knowledge Base system that enhances SQL query generation with context from DDL schemas, documentation, and example query pairs. We also significantly improved the chat session management, allowing users to maintain context across multiple interactions, save and reload chat sessions, and integrate training data with specific chat contexts. These enhancements make Sage.AI a more powerful and context-aware natural language to SQL assistant.

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Knowledge Base System

We implemented a sophisticated knowledge management system with three key components:

1. **Vector Database**
   - In-memory vector store with disk persistence
   - Simple vector embeddings for semantic similarity
   - Efficient similarity search for knowledge retrieval

2. **Knowledge Manager**
   - Three types of knowledge items:
     - DDL Schemas (database structure information)
     - Documentation (business logic and domain knowledge)
     - Question-SQL Pairs (example queries with natural language questions)
   - CRUD operations for knowledge items
   - Context retrieval for query enhancement

3. **Knowledge Integration**
   - Seamless integration with the query processing pipeline
   - Optional knowledge base usage toggle for users
   - Knowledge context tracking in chat responses

```go
// Knowledge retrieval example
func (km *KnowledgeManager) RetrieveRelevantKnowledge(ctx context.Context, query string) (*KnowledgeResult, error) {
    // Retrieve DDL schemas relevant to the query
    ddlItems, _ := km.vectorDB.FindSimilar(ctx, query, "ddl", 2)
    
    // Retrieve documentation relevant to the query
    docItems, _ := km.vectorDB.FindSimilar(ctx, query, "documentation", 3)
    
    // Retrieve question-SQL pairs relevant to the query
    qaPairs, _ := km.vectorDB.FindSimilar(ctx, query, "question_sql", 5)
    
    // Return combined knowledge context
    return &KnowledgeResult{
        DDLSchemas:       ddlItems,
        Documentation:    docItems,
        QuestionSQLPairs: convertToQuestionSQLPairs(qaPairs),
    }, nil
}
```

### Chat Session Management

We enhanced the chat system with persistent sessions and state management:

1. **Chat Store**
   - JSON-based persistence for chat sessions
   - Efficient CRUD operations for chat data
   - Automatic session recovery

2. **Chat-Training Data Association**
   - Ability to link training data items to specific chats
   - Prioritized knowledge context based on chat associations
   - Chat-specific knowledge management

3. **UI Enhancements**
   - New chat creation and selection
   - Chat history navigation
   - Chat deletion and management

```go
// Chat session persistence example
func (cs *ChatStore) saveChat(chat Chat) error {
    // Marshal to JSON
    chatData, err := json.MarshalIndent(chat, "", "  ")
    if err != nil {
        return fmt.Errorf("failed to marshal chat data: %w", err)
    }
    
    // Write to file
    chatPath := filepath.Join(cs.DataPath, chat.ID+".json")
    if err := os.WriteFile(chatPath, chatData, 0644); err != nil {
        return fmt.Errorf("failed to write chat file: %w", err)
    }
    
    return nil
}
```

### Testing Infrastructure

We created a comprehensive testing suite for the new features:

1. **Knowledge Base Unit Tests**
   - Vector database creation and persistence tests
   - Training item CRUD operation tests
   - Similarity search and retrieval tests

2. **Chat Session Tests**
   - Chat creation and persistence tests
   - Chat state management tests
   - Chat-training data association tests

3. **Integration Tests**
   - Knowledge integration with query generation
   - Chat session recovery and state management
   - End-to-end query processing with knowledge context

```go
// Example test case for knowledge retrieval
func TestRetrieveRelevantKnowledge(t *testing.T) {
    km, cleanup := setupTestKnowledgeManager(t)
    defer cleanup()
    
    ctx := context.Background()
    
    // Add test knowledge items
    err := km.AddDDLSchema(ctx, "products_schema", 
        "CREATE TABLE products (id INT, name VARCHAR(100), price DECIMAL(10,2))", 
        "Products table schema")
    assert.NoError(t, err)
    
    // Test retrieval with a query
    result, err := km.RetrieveRelevantKnowledge(ctx, "product prices")
    assert.NoError(t, err)
    
    // Verify results
    assert.NotEmpty(t, result.DDLSchemas, "Should find relevant DDL schemas")
    assert.Equal(t, "Products table schema", result.DDLSchemas[0].Description)
}
```

## 🚧 Challenges and Unmet Goals

3. 🎨 **Frontend Animations & Enhancements**
   - Planned **more dynamic UI interactions** but deprioritized for core functionality.
   - **Mobile UI optimizations** need further improvements.

4. 🎭 **Switching from Tailwind CSS to Material UI**  
   *Challenge: Transitioning from a utility-first CSS framework (Tailwind) to a component-based system (Material UI) led to delays in UI development.*  
   - Initially, the frontend team built layouts using **Tailwind CSS**, which provided a quick and flexible way to style components.
   - However, **Material UI was later chosen** due to its **prebuilt components, accessibility, and theming consistency**.
   - The shift required **rewriting existing components**, leading to unexpected UI inconsistencies and styling issues.
   - **Material UI’s styled components & system props** had a learning curve, especially in handling responsive design differently than Tailwind.
   - Although this transition was time-consuming, **it resulted in a more scalable, consistent, and maintainable UI**.
